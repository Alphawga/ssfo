SECTION 1: STRATEGY & CUSTOMER JOURNEY MAP

1.1 TARGET AUDIENCE PROFILES
Profile A: Founders Seeking Capital
Stage: Series A to Growth
Psychographics: Ambitious, time-poor, skeptical of "smart money" claims, seeking more than just capital
Decision trigger: Evidence of operational value-add beyond check-writing
Key question: "Will this investor actually help me scale, or just take a board seat?"
Profile B: Co-Investors & LPs
Stage: Evaluating allocation opportunities
Psychographics: Risk-conscious, relationship-driven, seeking deal flow access and alignment
Decision trigger: Track record, portfolio quality, principal credibility
Key question: "Is Edmund someone I want to be in business with for 10+ years?"
Profile C: Portfolio Company Executives
Stage: Existing relationship, seeking services
Psychographics: Operationally focused, need specialist support without full-time hires
Decision trigger: Clear service offerings, proven execution capability
Key question: "Can SSFO actually deliver CFO-level work, or is this a side project?"


Profile D: Strategic Partners & Media
Stage: Research and outreach
Psychographics: Information-gathering, credibility-checking
Decision trigger: Professional presence, clear positioning, accessible contact
Key question: "Is this a legitimate operation worth my time?"

1.2 POSITIONING STRATEGY
Against typical family offices: Most family offices are passive capital allocators—quiet LPs who write checks and wait. SSFO operates differently: active ownership, operational involvement, and a builder's mentality.
Recommended positioning: "Operator-led capital for businesses that build real economies."
Differentiation pillars:
Principal-led: Edmund Olotu's direct involvement, not delegated to junior associates
Operational DNA: Portfolio services aren't lip service—fractional CFO, M&A, digital transformation are core competencies
Sector depth: Deep expertise across energy, fintech, agribusiness—not generalist spray-and-pray
Geographic bridge: Abu Dhabi base with Africa/US portfolio creates unique deal flow access




1.3 RECOMMENDED TONE
Confident but not arrogant. Institutional credibility with founder accessibility. Think: "We've done this before, and we're selective about who we do it with."
Avoid: Corporate jargon, empty superlatives ("world-class," "best-in-class"), excessive formality that creates distance.
Embrace: Direct language, specificity, quiet confidence, outcome-orientation.

1.4 CUSTOMER JOURNEY MAP
Stage 1: Awareness
Entry points: Referral, LinkedIn, Google search, press mention, portfolio company reference
Mindset: "Who is SSFO? Is this legitimate?"
Goal: Establish credibility in 7 seconds
Psychological triggers: Authority (track record), Social proof (portfolio logos)
Stage 2: Consideration
Behavior: Scanning portfolio, reading about Edmund, assessing fit
Mindset: "Are they right for me? Do they invest in my sector/stage?"
Goal: Communicate thesis and value-add clearly
Psychological triggers: Specificity (clear criteria), Reciprocity (value offered upfront)
Stage 3: Evaluation
Behavior: Deep-diving services, looking for proof points, comparing to alternatives
Mindset: "What's the evidence they deliver?"
Goal: Neutralize objections, demonstrate results
Psychological triggers: Consistency (aligned messaging), Risk-reversal (clear process)

Stage 4: Decision
Behavior: Ready to reach out, looking for right contact path
Mindset: "How do I engage? What happens next?"
Goal: Friction-free conversion with clear next steps
Psychological triggers: Clarity (simple CTA), Commitment (low-barrier first step)

1.5 OBJECTION MAPPING
Likely Objection
Neutralization Strategy
"Never heard of them"
Portfolio logos, press mentions, Edmund's track record
"Just another passive family office"
Lead with operational services, active involvement language
"Too small to matter"
Emphasize principal access, speed of decision-making, flexibility
"Geographic mismatch"
Highlight multi-geography portfolio (Abu Dhabi, Africa, US)
"What's their actual thesis?"
Explicit investment criteria section


1.6 DROP-OFF RISK POINTS
Hero section unclear → Visitor leaves in <7 seconds
No visible portfolio → Credibility questioned
Services too vague → Portfolio companies don't engage
Contact form too demanding → Founders abandon submission
No clear investment criteria → Wrong-fit inquiries or no inquiries
